# MNEE CLI - Current Scope Document

## Purpose

This document summarizes the current capabilities and scope of the MNEE CLI, a command-line interface tool designed for interacting with MNEE USD (BSV-20 stablecoin) on the Bitcoin SV blockchain. This documentation is designed to align stakeholders on the existing functionality before proceeding to future enhancements, integrations, and development roadmap planning.

**Objective:**

Provide a user-friendly command-line interface that enables individuals to manage self-custody wallets and seamlessly interact with MNEE USD functionality ‚Äî supporting wallet creation, balance queries, transfers, transaction history, and secure key management without requiring deep blockchain knowledge.

‚ö† **Important:** The CLI is currently in active development (v1.1.0) and relies on the MNEE TypeScript SDK (v2.0.0) for core blockchain operations. While functional, it should be considered for personal and development use until comprehensive testing and security auditing are completed.

## Current CLI Interface

```bash
# Core wallet commands
mnee create                    # Create a new wallet
mnee import                    # Import wallet from WIF private key
mnee delete <walletName>       # Delete a wallet
mnee list                      # List and switch between wallets
mnee rename <old> <new>        # Rename a wallet

# Wallet operations
mnee address                   # Display active wallet address
mnee balance                   # Check MNEE balance
mnee transfer                  # Transfer MNEE to another address
mnee export                    # Export private key in WIF format

# Transaction history
mnee history                   # View transaction history
mnee history --unconfirmed     # Show unconfirmed transactions
mnee history --fresh           # Clear cache and fetch fresh history
```

**Interactive Features:**
- Environment selection (production/sandbox) during wallet creation
- Password confirmation for security operations
- Wallet switching interface with address truncation

## Current Limitations & Considerations

‚ùå **Single-Signature Only** ‚Äî Currently supports single-signature transactions only (no multi-sig capabilities)  
‚ùå **Limited Error Handling** ‚Äî Basic error responses; enhanced error categorization and recovery guidance needed  
‚ùå **No Batch Transfers** ‚Äî Single recipient transfers only; no multi-recipient transaction support  
‚ùå **Basic Transaction Validation** ‚Äî Limited pre-flight validation before transaction submission  
‚ùå **No Address Book** ‚Äî No contact/address management system for frequently used addresses  
‚ùå **Limited Analytics** ‚Äî Basic transaction history display; no advanced reporting or analytics features  
‚ùå **No Hardware Wallet Support** ‚Äî Software-only key management; no hardware wallet integration

## API Surface (via MNEE SDK Integration)

The CLI leverages the MNEE TypeScript SDK for all blockchain operations:

```typescript
// Core operations used by CLI
interface MneeSDKUsage {
  // Balance operations
  balance(address: string): Promise<MNEEBalance>;
  
  // Transfer operations
  transfer(request: SendMNEE[], wif: string): Promise<TransferResponse>;
  
  // History operations
  recentTxHistory(address: string, fromScore?: number, limit?: number): Promise<TxHistoryResponse>;
}
```

**CLI-Specific Enhancements:**
- Wallet management layer with secure key storage
- Interactive command-line interface with user prompts
- Local caching system for improved performance
- Multi-environment configuration management
- Password-protected operations with encryption
